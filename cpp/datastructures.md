# Data Structures for C++ Interviews

## Introduction
Notes from this article from [educative.io](https://www.educative.io/blog/cpp-data-structures-interview-prep). This revolves around data structures and their place in interview preparation.
### Important note
The article discusses common interview-style questions for all of the topics below. It's best to brush up on them and peep the link above when you get the chance.

## Arrays
- **Arrays** are a fundamental data structure that store a fixed-size sequence of elements of the same type.
- Implementation examples may include creating, accessing, and modifying array elements.
- Time and space complexities of array operations such as **insertion, deletion, and searching** are discussed.

## Linked Lists
- **Linked lists** are linear data structures composed of nodes that store data and reference the next node.
- Implementation examples cover **creating, traversing, inserting**, and **deleting nodes** in a linked list.
- Time and space complexities of linked list operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching are explained.

## Stacks
- **Stacks** are linear data structures that follow the *Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.*
- Implementation examples demonstrate the **stack's push, pop,** and **peek** operations.
- Time and space complexities of stack operations are explained.

## Queues
- **Queues** are linear data structures that follow the *First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle*.
- Implementation examples illustrate the **enqueue** and **dequeue** operations of a queue.
- Time and space complexities of queue operations are discussed.

## Trees
- **Trees** are hierarchical data structures composed of nodes, where each node has zero or more child nodes.
- Implementation examples cover **creating, traversing,** and **manipulating tree structures**.
- Time and space complexities of tree operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal algorithms are explored.

## Graphs
- **Graphs** are non-linear data structures composed of nodes (vertices) and connections (edges) between them.
- Implementation examples demonstrate **creating graphs, performing graph traversals**, and **applying graph algorithms**.
- Time and space complexities of graph operations such as traversal and searching are explained.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, understanding and mastering essential data structures in C++ is crucial for successful interview preparation. By practicing their implementation, analyzing their time and space complexities, and exploring common interview questions, you can enhance your problem-solving skills and improve your performance in coding interviews.
